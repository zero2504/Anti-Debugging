# Anti-Debugging

This project presents a simple but effective method for detecting debuggers through self-debugging. The technique uses the Windows API to apply a process to itself and identify potential debuggers. If an external debugger is already active, the self-debugging attempt will fail and the detection can take advantage of this to identify debugging activity. This approach is direct and efficient as it uses the standard features of the operating system to perform debugging detections with minimal overhead.

##  Technical background
Windows offers the option of debugging a process via the API function DebugActiveProcess by passing the process ID. The debugging connection can then be terminated again using the DebugActiveProcessStop function. A running process can attempt to treat itself as a debugger. However, if a debugger is already accessing this process, the self-debugging attempt fails and returns an error indicating the presence of a debugger.

## How the Technique Works
Self-Debugging Attempt: The program attempts to start debugging itself by passing its own process ID to the DebugActiveProcess function.

Detection:

1. If DebugActiveProcess is successful, no external debugger is active. The process ends the self-debugging session and resumes normal execution.
2. If DebugActiveProcess fails, it is likely that an external debugger is already active. The technique interprets this as an indication of active debugging.
